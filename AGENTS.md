# OSE Community Repository — Agent Instructions

This repository is the home for community-related discussions, governance processes, and shared resources for projects under the Open Source Europe (OSE) umbrella. Content is licensed under CC-BY-4.0, except `automation/`, which holds software licensed under MIT.

## Authorship Rules

- **NEVER add `Co-Authored-By:` with yourself as a co-author of any commit.** Agents are assistants and tools — they are not authors. Only humans can be authors of commits.
- AI assistance disclosure belongs in the pull request description using the exact format below — not in commit authorship metadata:
  ```
  Generated-by: <Agent Name and Version> following [AI Policy](https://github.com/opensourceeurope/.github/blob/main/AI-POLICY.md)
  ```

## Development Workflow

- **Never edit or develop on `main`.** Every change goes through a topic branch and a
  pull request. A `PreToolUse` hook enforces this: the shared main checkout is read-only
  for edits, and edits on `main`/`master` are denied in any worktree.
- Create a worktree per topic — `.claude/scripts/worktree.sh new <branch-name>` makes
  `.worktrees/<branch-name>` off a freshly fetched `origin/main` — then work in that
  directory. A single checkout has one `HEAD`, so concurrent sessions sharing it fight
  over the branch; a worktree pins one branch to one directory.
- `.claude/scripts/worktree.sh list` / `rm <branch-name>` manage them. `.worktrees/` is
  gitignored.

## Commit Conventions

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `chore:`
- Two licences apply by path: everything under `automation/` is MIT (software);
  everything else is CC-BY-4.0 (content). Do not introduce material that is
  incompatible with the licence of the path you are touching.
